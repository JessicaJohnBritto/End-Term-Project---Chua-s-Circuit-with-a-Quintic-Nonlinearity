August, 2021 - November, 2021

In this paper, we explore the chaotic phenomenon in a Chuaâ€™s circuit with a nonlinear resistor with a smooth nonlinearity and
compare it with the piecewise linear case. Since the cubic nonlinearity has been studied before, here as an example, we study the
Quintic nonlinearity, derive the differential equations, calculate the Jacobian matrix and study the phase plots and attractors
obtained with different parameter values through MATLAB simulations and pinpoint the points of Bifurcation.
